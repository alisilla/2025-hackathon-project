Piet Paint, a painting software that allows users create abstract art.

Initial project was to create a painting software that is drawn upon by adding functions. 
Functions could be colored and the graph could be colored up to the point where it makes contact with funcions.

Scope was too large for the time left available so one member offered to modify program.

New project introduces user to Piet Paint, which allows user to customize the square by the color of its outline, the color of its interior, and its rotation in the Shape window.
The user can then press and/or hold the cursor anywhere on the Canvas window to start generating the shape which grows until the user lets go of the mouse.
This can be done over and over until the user is satisfied with the piece they made.
Additionally, if the user needs inspiration they can randomize any and all of the options for the square in their piece.
Afterwards, the user can save their canvas as a png.

Unfortately, at the time of writing all that works is the user can open up the two windows.
